親愛的讀者朋友：

不是每個人都對心理學及神經科學有興趣，但安德烈相信多數人會想要了解自己的心理狀態，明白自己的大腦如何做出決策。

因此，今天安德烈要向你推薦一本好書：謝伯讓教授的《都是大腦搞的鬼》。

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.
